some scripts for autoworkflow

## Story
First time I want to use the applescripts is to learn a GTD software. I found that workflow in Mac is wonderful, but the scripts are hard to write. The hardest part is to find the key and value in the dict.

For this reason I record some scripts here. I'm just a starter. haha..

## Important things
- applescripts with the bash or zsh bash
- applescripts with the python
- applescripts with other language such as ruby
